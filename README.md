# Fan-tasize

## Synopsis:

Researching players for a fantasy football team can be a chore, especially when someone who doesn't follow the sport closely decides to join a league. That's where Fan-tasize comes in. Fan-tasize is an easy solution for viewing the top ranked players in various positions, allowing users to create a mock team for when the draft rolls around. If a user wants to add a player to their team, they can do so with just a click of a button. Their mock team will then be displayed in the sidebar, so that users can easily keep track of who they have chosen.
